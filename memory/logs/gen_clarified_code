App: The main component that serves as the entry point for the application.\n2.

Login: A component that renders the login form and handles the user login process.\n4. Logout: A component that handles the user logout process.\n5. Register: A component that renders the registration form and handles the user registration process.\n6. SecurePage: A component that represents a secure page that requires the user to be logged in to access.\n\nNow, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.\n\n1. Create a new file named `App.js`:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { AuthProvider } from './AuthProvider';\nimport Login from './Login';\nimport Logout from './Logout';\nimport Register from './Register';\nimport SecurePage from './SecurePage';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <AuthProvider>\n      <Router>\n        <Switch>\n          <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Login} />\n          <Route path=\"/register\" component={Register} />\n          <Route path=\"/logout\" component={Logout} />\n          <Route path=\"/secure\" component={SecurePage} />\n        </Switch>\n      </Router>\n    </AuthProvider>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n2. Create a new file named `AuthProvider.js`:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nexport const AuthContext = createContext();\n\nexport const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  const login = (email, password) => {\n    // Implement Azure AD B2C login logic here\n    // Set the authenticated user in the state\n  };\n\n  const logout = () => {\n    // Implement Azure AD B2C logout logic here\n    // Clear the authenticated user from the state\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout }}>\n      {children}\n    </AuthContext.Provider>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n3. Create a new file named `Login.js`:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useContext, useState } from 'react';\nimport { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { AuthContext } from './AuthProvider';\n\nconst Login = () => {\n  const { login } = useContext(AuthContext);\n  const history = useHistory();\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n\n  const handleLogin = (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    login(email, password);\n    history.push('/secure');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Login</h2>\n      <form onSubmit={handleLogin}>\n        <input\n          type=\"email\"\n          placeholder=\"Email\"\n          value={email}\n          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        />\n        <input\n          type=\"password\"\n          placeholder=\"Password\"\n          value={password}\n          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Login;\n```\n\n4. Create a new file named `Logout.js`:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useContext } from 'react';\nimport { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { AuthContext } from './AuthProvider';\n\nconst Logout = () => {\n  const { logout } = useContext(AuthContext);\n  const history = useHistory();\n\n  const handleLogout = () => {\n    logout();\n    history.push('/');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Logout</h2>\n      <button onClick={handleLogout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Logout;\n```\n\n5. Create a new file named `Register.js`:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useContext, useState } from 'react';\nimport { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { AuthContext } from './AuthProvider';\n\nconst Register = () => {\n  const { login } = useContext(AuthContext);\n  const history = useHistory();\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n\n  const handleRegister = (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    // Implement Azure AD B2C registration logic here\n    // After successful registration, automatically log in the user\n    login(email, password);\n    history.push('/secure');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Register</h2>\n      <form onSubmit={handleRegister}>\n        <input\n          type=\"email\"\n          placeholder=\"Email\"\n          value={email}\n          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        />\n        <input\n          type=\"password\"\n          placeholder=\"Password\"\n          value={password}\n          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Register</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Register;\n```\n\n6. Create a new file named `SecurePage.js`:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useContext } from 'react';\nimport { Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { AuthContext } from './AuthProvider';\n\nconst SecurePage = () => {\n  const { user } = useContext(AuthContext);\n\n  if (!user) {\n    return <Redirect to=\"/\" />;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Secure Page</h2>\n      <p>Welcome, {user.email}!</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default SecurePage;\n```\n\nThis completes the implementation of the React application with Azure AD B2C integration. The code provided includes the necessary components and logic to handle user registration, login, logout, and secure page access. The Azure AD B2C integration is not fully implemented as it requires additional configuration and implementation specific to the Azure AD B2C service."}]
